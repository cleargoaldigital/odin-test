First The Odin Project Practice Test

I stumbled over a link to the The Odin Project (TOP) learning plaform recently and have since been hooked by the inutitively and brillaintly logical sequence of teaching put together by this amazing Project Team.

From spending a couple of hours on the website, I have been able to install (and start using) vitual machine on my windows laptop. In fact, the README is created using the VM.

I have also learnt the core of GIT, its significance and use. I have been able to seamlessly link my Github to GIT in a way I have never used.

I hope to use this medium to update my progress on the learning platform where I have registered to learn Javascript.

I am really excited and can't wait to finish the course in record time.

I am very grateful to the Odin Project.
